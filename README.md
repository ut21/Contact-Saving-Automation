# Contact-Saving-Automation
A simple python script reads contact information from a CSV file and generates contact cards which are then stored in a .vcf file and hence can be saved with just one click. I built mostly as a utility tool to make my life easier re department work. Also a good use case for working with data analysis and cleaning, and files in python. 
## NOTE
I have not included the csv file in the repo because of privacy reasons as it contains more than 200 contacts. Also, the initial cleaning code is mostly unique to the data I had, specifically, multiple contatcs for one person, the Mobile No. series including some instacnes with spaces in between, rogue commas, etc. The rest of the code should be useable if you feed it clean data
